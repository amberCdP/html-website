        <p> Uhm.. Is this still considered a bread? Well.. I guess it's made out of bread...<br>
            Almost every culture has it's own version of french toast. In French it is called "pain perdu" and in Dutch "verloren brood".<br>
            When translated, both mean the same thing: lost bread. This name makes sense when you know french toast is made with stale bread.<br>
            The bread is then soaked in eggs, milk or cream and then pan-fried. It is mainly served as a sweet dish,<br>
            but there are some weirdo's that like it savory, I guess.<br>   
            You can also make this with stale croissants,<br>
            but never let a French person know you did this, as this might lead them to start another revolution.
