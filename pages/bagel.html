        <h1>Bagel</h1>
        <img src="../images/bagel.jpg" alt="A variety of different types of bagels" style="height: 250px;">
        <p> Although bagels look reminiscent of donuts, they are a completely different thing!<br>
            Before they are baked, bagels are boiled in water, resulting in a dense, doughy interior with a browned, crisp exterior.<br>
            They are often topped with seeds and can be eaten with savory or sweet filings.<br> 
            A tasty choice! But be careful; they can be quite calorie dense! (I personally don't care though..)
