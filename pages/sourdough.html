        <p>Making sourdough bread is very labor intensive, but it is a labor of love.<br> 
            To be able to create sourdough bread, one must first have a thriving <a href="https://www.theclevercarrot.com/2019/03/beginner-sourdough-starter-recipe/">sourdough starter</a>, which is essentially wild yeast.<br>
            This starter will not only proof your bread, but it will also give it its iconic, slightly acidic flavor.<br>
            Sourdough bread is fermented and therefore pretty healthy!</p>
